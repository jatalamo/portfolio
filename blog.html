   <p>Ok well if you've read my "about me" page, you will understand this photo. This is a dream of mine. I preach this all the time to my kids. When they have a small problem at school etc., I remind them that there are 7 billion people in the world, and that Hillsborough means nothing! I want them to see places, <em> I</em> want to see places, you gain so much perspective when you are 30 thousand feet in the air looking down, or riding a golf cart down a dirt road in Belize (yes we did that!)</p>
    <p>When you explore the world and your problems seem to disappear, it does something to you. Wish I could afford to do more, but for now I do what I can. Next stop...Who knows!</p>
