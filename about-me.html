    <h3>Thanks for your interest in learning about me! <img src="about-me.jpg" height="160" align="left" >I am excited to share a bit about my life and my journey as a Rutger's Web Development Programming student at the age of 50!</h3>
    <p>
    I am New Jersey native and have lived here most of my life, <img src="jill.png" align="right" > (except for 5 years where I lived in Mississippi & New Orleans. It was a great experience and so much fun!) I am married to Joe, have 2 children, Joey and Gigi and we live in Hillsborough, New Jersey. We have 3 rescued dogs and I am a very active animal rescue volunteer. Helping dogs and abused farm animals is one of my passions! I also love to travel and bring my kids to unique places each year.<i> "Never the same vacation twice until you've seen it all"</i> is my motto! For fun, I am a novice author of a blog entitled "Things I saw Today" where I simply "Stop & Smell the Roses of Daily life." You'll pretty much be walking in my shoes! I hope you will check it out!</p>
    <p>
    My first career was in the Hotel/Casino Industry, lasting 15 years and spanning three states. I was a Blackjack and Baccarat Dealer, Supervisor, Trainer and finally, a Manager. It was alot of fun, but the years of graveyard shift were taking their toll on me and it was not very rewarding or creative. With the help and advice of several family members in the Programming field, In 1998 I decided on a career change into Computer Programming. I attended The Chubb Institute of Computer Programming for their one-year training course where I achieved the status of "Honor Student." I learned COBOL, JCL, Visual Basic and some other now outdated stuff! I knew I found my passion! Upon graduation, I was hired by Prudential Financial as a PeopleSoft Analyst. At the same time, I was newly married and the following year, welcomed the arrival of my first child. Faced with a really touch choice,  I decided to stay home, raise kids and forego my new career. I felt lucky to even have this option, as so many moms don't!...And time slipped away, until now, 15 years later! </p>

    I never forgot about programming and the sense of accomplishment it gave me and knew I would return to it "one day". Well, "one day" is Now! I am thrilled to be a student again, learning the newest technologies of Web development at Rutger's. Students in this program will learn a full-stack, including HTML5, CSS3, FTP, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Database Theory, ActiveRecord, Command Line, Git, and Collaborative Software Development. 

    <p>With nothing to stop me now, I truly am looking forward to getting back out into the professional world and contributing my creative passion and talent to the universe.  I'm excited!<strong> Programming, I have missed you!</strong>
